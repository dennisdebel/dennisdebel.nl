Skippy 2000 is the first eurorack compatible Compact Disk player controllable with control voltage (CV). 

<br><br>
Following year(s) of experimentation, the first batch was expected end of November 2021. This batch turned out to be a dud and there are only two unique working versions as of July 2022. If you are interested in helping out or have tips to make this more reproducable at a sample size larger than a one-off, don't hesitate to contact me.
