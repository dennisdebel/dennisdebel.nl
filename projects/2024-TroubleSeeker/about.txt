<h2> Update! New iteration!</h2>
The TroubleSeeker is an amazing device to explore electromagnetic phenomenons and well suited for ages 7 and up to assemble. This success inspired the next iteration, a stereo edition, with some extra magic! Enter binaural beats and visualisation. More updates soon, keep an eye on the GIT repository down below! <br><br>

Instructions to produce your own will be added and updated <a href="https://github.com/dennisdebel/BinauralBeeps">here</a>.
