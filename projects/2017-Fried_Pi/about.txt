A study to develop generic cases for electronics as quickly, cheaply and organic/edible as possible. The ingredients: A Raspberry Pi SBC, some tap water, flour, egg and breadcrumbs into a deep fryer at 180deg C rendered a perfectly working computer. Sure, the SBC overheated, but even after dunking it into the deep frying for 5 times, it would still boot up after cooling and displaying graphics via HDMI. End scene.
