Copyright 2010 is a collaboration between JODI and de Bel. As a groteske reenactment of Google’s barely noticable watermarks on Google Maps Street View imagery it shows us the
 absurdity of Google's omnipresence in both our digital and physical reality along side the companies mission to 'copyright the world'. The work involved an commercial advertising airplane fitted with a 25 x 5m fabric banner with the text “©2009 Google” trailing behind it. Photo by Alina Parigger.
