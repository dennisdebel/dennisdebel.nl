'Navigating Huaqiangbei' is a personal attempt to make sense of the overwhelming Huaqiangbei electronics markets in Shenzhen, China and is a small part of the long term commitment to the area (2014-2026). The project discusses previous attempts, possible ways to practically research such large topics/areas as well as the role, position and development of art, or 'the artist' in both research and everyday life. <br><br>

Through observation, pseudo-archeology, meandering, listening nearby and making friends I tried to develop artistic research methods that depart from 'taking' (taking pictures, taking inspiration, taking stories) to find ways of giving back.
