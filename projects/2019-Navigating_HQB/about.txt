'Navigating Huaqiangbei' is a personal attempt to make sense of the overwhelming Huaqiangbei electronics markets in Shenzhen, China and is a small part of the long term commitment to the area (2014-2026). The project discusses previous attempts, possible ways to practically research such large topics/areas as well as the role, position and development of art, or 'the artist' in both research and everyday life. <br><br>

Through observation, pseudo-archeology, meandering, listening nearby and making friends I tried to develop artistic research methods that depart from 'taking' (taking pictures, taking inspiration, taking stories) to find ways of giving back.

One of the tracks involved picking up pieces of electronics, mainly from phones, from the cracks in the street. The residue of what later turned out to be the setting of a clandestine night market. The pieces were mapped and reconstructed into a new 'phone' (last image). The other track was a discussion and sharing session at Handshake 302, Baishizhou, Shenzhen.
