SESD, or Sculptural Electronic Sound Discs is a research and production project initiated by DE PLAYER (Rotterdam, NL) on merging sound source (electronic circuits) and the carrier (vinyl) into a dynamic, sculptural sound object.

<br>
Do It Yourself play a leading role in this program. with Dennis de Bel, Gert-Jan Prins, Gijs Gieskes, Tom Verbruggen On the spot they will experiment with electronic circuits, e.g. converted consumer electronics or self-designed electronic units that are used as a tool. The medium in this case, is a self-cut master plate which prints can be made by means of liquid plastics. These two elements are combined into an active sound composition. The artists are expected to increase their ability to innovative and conceptual thinking, their affinity with the material or tactile, the Do-It-Yourself attitude, and the handling of sound as an artistic sculptural data insertion.<br>
 The project is exemplary for the in- and output DE PLAYER intends to generate as a stage. Exchange of knowledge with the artists, DE PLAYER and the audience is central to this project. 
DE PLAYER provided the knowledge and capabilities in small run (re)production of sound recordings in the tradition of vinyl / LP (cutting, molds, casting). The contribution of the invited artists is their electronic specialization, their ability to (re)use and expand upon everyday electronic objects. The combination of this knowledge results into physical and dynamic sound objects.
