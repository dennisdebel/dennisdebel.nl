<a href="https://dennisdebel-nl.pages.dev/?section=projects&project=2020-Walkie_Talkie" target="_blank">Walkie Talkie</a> was featured in the amazing Under The Cloud publication by Iris Long and He Zike. <br><br>

Under the Cloud, a new publication compiling research gathered during their field study in the Guizhou province of Southwest China.<br><br>

Between 2021-2023 several groups of artists, curators, media theorists, and anthropologists travelled to Guizhou. The province is one of the eight national ‘big data hubs’ under the ‘Data in the East, Computing in the West program,’ the Chinese strategic approach to data that aims to leverage the distinct advantages of each region toward technological growth. The groups, led by curator Iris Long and artist Zike He, visited key sites* of computational infrastructure (the hardware, software, and networking components that collectively enable computers to run and process data) that have emerged in Guizhou province over the last decade. The ‘Under the Cloud’** publication documents these explorations into the real-world implications of techno-industrial policy that increasingly aims to optimise data and computing capabilities to adopt artificial intelligence. Written in English and Chinese, it includes artist interviews and contributions by researchers, artists and science fiction writers. <br><br>

Sites visited include Huawei Cloud Gui’an Data Center, Gui’an Supercomputing Center, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Radio Astronomy and Data Processing, The Big Data Security Exhibition Centre, Guiyang Meteorological Bureau, Guiyang National Reference Climate Station, Key Laboratory of Information and Computing Science Guizhou Province, Guizhou Cloud Big Data Group, Big Data Expo Guyang, Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, Yunding Wind Farm of Power China Guizhou Engineering Co, LTD, Huawei Guizhou Cloud Development Innovation Center. <br><br>

‘Under the Cloud’ is part of a long-term project called ‘PORT’ by Long and He that focuses on the narratives of technological infrastructures in China. <br><br>
