#1: EPHEMERAL ENCODINGS <br>
How can sound contribute to restoring our relationship
with the material world of computation now that
(operational) sounds are disappearing? 
<br><br>
Processes of computer activity such as loading, storing
and networking used to make certain kinds of sound. Due
to technological developments, this is currently evolving
into silence. The mechanical sounds from the fan might
be one of the last sonic traces left to connect us to the
material world of computation.

This first issue revolves around the topic how sound can
play a role in the perception of the material properties
of computation as the latter is often perceived as
‘immaterial’. The publication consists of 2 booklets and
an audio cassette. The first part is a collection of stories
and anecdotes by 18 contributors. For this part, each
contributor was invited to share a vivid memory or
almost-forgotten experience of how sound connected
them to the material world of computation and digital
networking. To enrich their stories, each contributor
provided a piece of audio and a (modulated) image with
their text. The second part is a thesis that discusses the
topic of the disappearing sound of computer activity
more in-depth.<br><br>

I contributed an article called 'Rumbling Clouds' on the noise of data centers.
