Networks Of One’s Own is a para-nodal periodic publication that is itself collectively written in a network. Each of the episodes is thought of as the ‘release’ of a specific software stack, contextualised in its specific practice. The series aims to document a set of tools, experiences, ways of working that are diverse in terms of their temporality, granularity and persistence. Three takes on taking care is the second volume of this series. Read more <a href="http://varia.zone/en/networks-of-ones-own.html">here</a>.
