3×3 is an initiative by <a href="https://v2.nl/" target="_blank">V2_</a> offering artists the resources to experiment with formats, audiences and time. Experiments, beta versions and try-outs offer an inside look on how an artist thinks and works. <a href="https://v2.nl/" target="_blank">V2_</a> offers three artists space, time and resources to develop three experiments. Every first Friday evening of the month the public can witness one of these experiments live. A unique experience, since no one knows what experiments will lead to.
<br><br>
In this 3×3 V2_radio session Dennis de Bel, Iris Long and V2_ experiment with the format of the radio program. Each session invites different guests to take a “zoom-in” journey across time, scale, altitudes and attitudes: from a bird’s eye view (or is it a kite?) down to the ground to the insides of a cave, encompassing topics of planetary computation, data centers, geology, extraction, history of China’s third-front movement, digital-colonialism and so forth.<br><br>

<b>Session 1</b><br>
Dennis de Bel invite Iris Long and Solveig Qu Suess for a conversation on the notion of planetary infrastructure/mega-structures.
