Wising up to the Smart City is a comprehensive, hands-on study of smart technologies in China with a focus on Shanghai through hands-on research, manufacturing electronics, coding and play.
<br><br>
The Smart City is often presented as an efficient, uncontested, monolithic entity governed by
algorithms and technology. During this course we will problematize the Smart City through
mapping, making and active engagement with the various manifestations of smart technologies
on the streets of Shanghai.<br><br>

Conversely, we will draw on local resources, knowledge and economies to explore more
informal technological practices that challenge the homogeneous nature of the Smart City,
practices that open up technological knowledge hierarchies (shanzhai, repair, bootleg) and give
insight into scarcity (energy, ecology, recycling).<br><br>

In practice, this course introduces various research methodologies (mapping, field research,
reverse engineering and playful engagement) as well as getting hands-on experience with the
design and manufacturing of electronics and coding (arduino/C++).<br><br>

Furthermore, we will establish a comprehensive understanding of (smart) technology through a
series of excursions and self-directed field research to, amongst others, the Smart City Expo
Shanghai trade show, NYU Shanghai’s High Performance Computing data center and local
electronics wholesale markets.<br><br>
