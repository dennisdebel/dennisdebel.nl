8 November 2015 at FLAT with Rosa Menkman<br>
FLAT invited the Amsterdam and Internet-based work group Browserbased to work and present in FLAT Station to present work and events over the winter period. This event hosted the artists Rosa Menkman and Dennis De Bel giving two separate artist talks in the FLAT Station Project space, while soup and the infamous Browserbased alcoholic pun beverages 'Screenshots' were served. 
Rosa Menkman is an artist and theorist who focuses on visual noise artifacts, resulting from accidents in both analogue and digital media (such as glitch, encoding and feedback artifacts). Although many people perceive these accidents as negative experiences, Menkman emphasizes their positive consequences: these artifacts facilitate an important insight into the otherwise obscure alchemy of standardization via resolutions: the creation of solutions or protocols, and their black-boxed, unseen, forgotten or obfuscated compromises and alternative possibilities.
Dennis de Bel graduated in June 2007 as an Interactive Media designer at the Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam. In June 2009, he completed the Master Media Design and Communication at the Piet Zwart Institute, also in Rotterdam. Currently, he is teaching at the Willem de Kooning Academy, and creating his own works under the Dilly Dally Foundry label. His work focusses on consuming de- sign/design interventions/questionable design and positions itself in-between art, anti-art, industrial design, product and (non)-objects.
