Event Horizon Ulrika Gomm, Dennis de Bel and Tessa Zettel 

<br><br>

Opening Event Horizon: Friday 23 November 2018, 7 – 10 pm

<br><br>

A collective night of readings in the spaces of IFP by Ulrika Gomm, Dennis de Bel and Tessa Zettel. With hot toddies and cozy corners.

<br><br>

At 8 pm Ulrika Gomm will present Practise Horizon, performed in English and Chinese (with Dakota Guo) in the installation at Black Sesame, using the book titles as material for a new composition.

<br><br> 

In the courtyard, Dennis de Bel will guide our gaze towards a curious geostationary object in the sky.

<br><br> 

In the ifp studio space, Tessa Zettel shares miscellaneous readings from unfinished encyclopedia The Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge and its ancillary Extinction Club Reading Group.

<br><br> 

Stay on afterwards to peruse various publications by all three artists in a special cosy cat corner of the studio.
