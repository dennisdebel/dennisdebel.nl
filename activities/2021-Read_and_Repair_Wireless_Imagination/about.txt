<p>In this live soldering session (on Jitsi) Dennis and Danny will take you through the steps to recreate a simple analog television transmitter as designed by Tetsuo Kogawa. We will cover the actual construction of the transmitter, what to transmit and how to receive the signal. In the end we will take requests from the audience.</p>
<p>Every last Sunday of the month the Varia Library and the Rotterdam Electronica Depot hold Read &amp; Repair events. Due to current circumstances, most of them have been in an online format.
We invite you to visit our online space, make yourself comfortable, read or repair some things together, and share our thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>In 2021 our Read &amp; Repair sessions will be paired, we will take two months to explore one theme. During January and February 2021, we will be exploring the theme Wireless Imagination. Transmission, radio, resonance and orality are at play in these sessions, where we will learn from, and act on, methods used in activist radio and the polyphonous histories of radio art.</p>
<p>On Sunday 28th February we have a REPAIR, led by Dennis de Bel followed by a READ with Agustina Woodgate.</p>
<p><strong>REPAIR</strong></p>
<p>The Repair session of this theme is hosted by <strong>Dennis de Bel</strong> with the contribution of <strong>Danny van der Kleij</strong>.</p>
<p>Dennis de Bel (1984, Rotterdam, NL) is a hands-on artistic researcher, educator and radio amateur.
His practice oscillates between various configurations of collaborations focusing on collectively exploring hardware, software and a plethora of waves.</p>
<p><strong>READ</strong></p>
<p>The text selection and our reading choreography in February was made by <strong>Agustina Woodgate</strong>. </p>
<p>Agustina Woodgate (1981, Argentina) practice focuses on the politics of landscapes and infrastructures as public geography. She often collaborates with a team of international agents testing new ways of exploring the networked planet, developing strategies that can seize new opportunities, exposing and reprogramming tools and information technologies. 
She broadcasts with radioee.net, pub.sandberg.nl and tvgov.info.</p>

<p>Tune in to <a href="http://varia.zone/en/pages/stream.html">http://varia.zone/en/pages/stream.html</a> for an experimental multi port broadcasting session with the contribution of <strong>Angeliki Diakrousi</strong>.</p>
<p>In this sonic session we will read all together over the multi-port stream creating a collaborative response. The radio trasnsmission will brings us together through a broadcasted soundscape. The readers are invited to send voice notes via telegram translating excerpts over audio clips (whispering, screaming, languages, special fxs, sounds, noises, etc.) 
During this session readers become listeners and radio hosts. No preparation is required.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction/Reaction:</strong></p>
<p>You can send the audio files in two ways: through a Telegram group or through a shared folder.</p>
<p>A Telegram Group has been created for participants to send their audio clips. </p>

<p><strong>Date</strong>: Sunday, 28th February 2021</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 19:00-21:00 CET</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: <a href="http://varia.zone/en/pages/stream.html">http://varia.zone/en/pages/stream.html</a></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This reading session will be held in English.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no prior reading needed before we come together to Read, we experience the texts for the first time together and will send out a link for download during the event.</p>
<p>The further themes we'll be looking at in 2021 are Digital Solidarity, The Automated Body, Sense-full Pedagogy and Community Memory.</p>
<p>Read is alternatively guided by a Varia Library group member, the following Read (in the next month) is guided by a guest. Both sessions revolve around the same theme, with different texts and methods to read them. The guest Read session is accompanied a Repair session. The Repair session is a practical exploration of the same theme, led by a guest or a Rotterdam Eletronica Depot member. It is an active workshop you can experiment with at home, and one day in our Depot, when we can physically gather.</p>
<p>Our January-September 2021 programme is funded by Gemeente Rotterdam.</p>
