<blockquote>
<p>Taking inspiration from [<a href="https://test.roelof.info/projects/prettyfly/">Pretty Fly For A Wi-Fi</a>, in this workshop led by
<a href="/">Roel Roscam Abbing</a> and <a href="http://dennisdebel.nl">Dennis de Bel</a> participants learn to construct their own do-it-yourself Wi-Fi antennas using locally sourced materials.</p>
<p>During the workshop participants will learn the theory behind the transition of a cheese tin into a Wi-Fi antenna, how this knowledge can be used to make one&rsquo;s own antenna and how to test them for signal strength. The workshop will end with a testing session to determine which antenna designs have the strongest signal.</p>
<h3 id="material">Material</h3>
<p>To use the Wi-Fi antenna it is recommended to bring a usb Wi-Fi dongle with detachable antenna (recommended model: TP-Link TL-WN722N) and a N-male to RP-SMA-male cable (this one for example).</p>
