'Navigating Huaqiangbei' is the document of a personal attempt to make sense of the overwhelming Huaqiangbei electronics markets and is a small part of a long term commitment to the area (2014-2018). The project discusses previous attempts, possible ways to practically research such large topics/areas as well as the role, position and development of art, or 'the artist' in both research and everyday life. <br><br>

Examples include; looking at (diy)tools to understand the ecosystems at play, practicing pseudo-archeology to understand (a phones) life, meandering, reading your environment, making friends and how to developing artistic practices from merely 'taking' (taking pictures, taking inspiration, taking stories) to 'contributing', or ways of giving back to a community both large and small.<br><br>
