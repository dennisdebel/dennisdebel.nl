Science Friction explores how emerging technologies, societal tensions and global trends
collide to shape the near future. Through speculative design, critical making, and hands-on
prototyping, students extrapolate today’s techno-social issues into provocatively plausible future scenarios and communicate these scenarios through material, experienceable form.

Students will create working speculative prototypes that embody alternative technological
futures. These prototypes act as “friction devices”: tools for questioning assumptions, surfacing unintended consequences, and imagining technologies that could (or perhaps should not) exist. <br><br>

Originally co-developed as an elective at the Design Academy Eindhoven, Science Friction
combines electronics, sensors, microcontrollers, narrative world-building, rapid prototyping, and critical reflection into a compact studio sprint.
