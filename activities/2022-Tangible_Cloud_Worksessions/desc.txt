Tangible Cloud gathered thirty people from different backgrounds (artists, designers, philosophers, economists, etc.) in two worksessions, which took place in May and June 2022 in Brussels. Together, they tried to imagine, through artistic practices, counter-narratives to the mainstream vision of digital: cloud computing.<br><br>

A set of interviews was conducted with all participants in December 2023, follwing the worksessions, and a resitution of all the production was set in March 2023, at the KBK Gallery in Brussels.<br><br>

This project was supported by ÉSA Le 75 and FRArt. It was initiated by Alex Leray, Antoine Gelgon, Romain Marula and Marianne Plano.<br><br>
